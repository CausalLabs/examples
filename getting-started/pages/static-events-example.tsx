// In this example we are going to:
// 1. Collect the data server side.
// 2. Pass the data to the page w/o the help of Causal's types.
// 3. use Causa's static functions on the client to signal events.
//
// This mimics how front end code might interact with a micro-service.
// You might want a microservice to get data from Causal. That microservice
// may already have a public interface, so you don't want to add new piping.
//
// Causal will still tie all the data together, and you still
// get the benefit of annotated and strongly typed interfaces.

  }

  // An impression corresponds to a user viewing a page or product.
  // The front end and back end need to agree on impressions.
  // They do this by using ids to identify impressions.
  // Causal can generate ids for you, however many times

  // based on the request ids provided by a webserver

          //   deprecation indications.
          //
          // The downside to this approach is the type system can not carry
          // the feature selection through from the original query, so you
          // have to manually pick the correct features to signal events on.
